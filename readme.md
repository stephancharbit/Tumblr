## Tumblr

The purpose of this homework is to leverage animations and gestures to create custom navigation. We're going to use the techniques from this week to implement some interactions in Tumblr.

Time spent: 11 hours

### Features

#### Required

- [X] Tapping on Home, Search, Account, or Trending should show the respective screen and highlight the tab bar button.

#### Optional

#### The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Correct autoresizing settings for Scroll views and and contents
2. Better transitions

## Notes

– I can't seem to get the scroll view in the 'Feed' tab to work correctly – something to do with positioning and autoresizing... grrr.

– The 'account' button won't deselect... I have tried re-creating the button from scratch, and copying over a working button from one of the other tab bar buttons, but no luck

– The positioning of the various image views in the Home view is not what is represented in interfcae builder

* Any libraries or borrowed content.
